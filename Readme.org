* Usage and reason

Use to store normal alias or useful functions to accelerate shell command execution. 

Normally I have to work on bash in company and on zsh in my personal machine, so I want some common and normal scripts can be stored in a folder, managed by git.

* TODOs

- [ ] basic plugin selection and control
- [X] basic plugin folder
- [X] emacs alias
- [X] add readme
